                  Windows Media Audio decoder interface.


    This module implements the interface and output system for Windows Media
Audio. If you use this module with your application, you will need to deploy
wmaudioredist.exe (the CORE) with your program.
    The SDK (and the CORE) are claimed by Microsoft to be BETA. It seems  to
work correctly, but beware of BETA! 
    Please, notify me, when Microsoft releases the final version of the SDK.

    Redistribution terms for this module consist of two parts.
1) wmamp.esp redistribution terms are defined by EldoS Sounds license.
2) The CORE redistribution terms are defined by Microsoft. As  for  now  its
redistribution is free.
