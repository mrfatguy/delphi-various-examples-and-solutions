  This is the Info-ZIP file COPYING (for UnZip), last updated 2 Sep 93.
__________________________________________________________________________

  There are currently two explicit copyrights on portions of UnZip
   code (at least, of which Info-ZIP is aware):  the original Sam Smith
   copyright on unzip 2.0, upon which Info-ZIP's UnZip 3.0 was based;
   and Igor Mandrichenko's copyright on his routines in vms.c.  These
   are discussed immediately below; the Frequently Asked Questions re-
   garding (re)distribution of Zip and UnZip are near the end of this
   file.
__________________________________________________________________________

   The original unzip source code has been extensively modified and
   mostly rewritten (changes include random zipfile access rather than
   sequential; replacement of unimplode() with explode(); replacement
   of output routines; addition of inflate(), wildcards, filename-
   mapping, text translation, ...; etc.).  As far as we can tell, the
   only remaining code which is substantially similar to Mr. Smith's
   is that in the files unreduce.c and unshrink.c (although even those
   have been modified), to which the following copyright therefore
   applies:

     * Copyright 1989 Samuel H. Smith;  All rights reserved
     *
     * Do not distribute modified versions without my permission.
     * Do not remove or alter this notice or any other copyright notice.
     * If you use this in your own program you must distribute source code.
     * Do not use any of this in a commercial product.

   Regarding the first stipulation, Mr. Smith was finally tracked down
   in southern California [Samuel H. Smith, The Tool Shop, P.O. Box 8808,
   Panorama City, CA  91412-4808, (818) 891-4228 (voice), (818) 891-6780
   (BBS, 2400 baud, free access)]:

   "He says that he thought that whoever contacted him understood that
    he has no objection to the Info-ZIP group's inclusion of his code.
    His primary concern is that it remain freely distributable, he said."

   Info-ZIP is indebted and grateful to Mr. Smith; we hope he finds our
   contributions as useful as we have his.

   Note that the third and fourth stipulations still apply to any com-
   pany which wishes to incorporate the unreduce and/or unshrink code 
   into its products; if you wish to do so, you must contact Mr. Smith
   regarding licensing.


   The following copyright applies to most of the VMS code in vms.c,
   distributed with UnZip versions 4.2 and later:
     * Copyright (C) 1992 Igor Mandrichenko.
     * Permission is granted to any individual or institution to use,
     * copy, or redistribute this software so long as all of the orig-
     * inal files are included unmodified, that it is not sold for
     * profit, and that this copyright notice is retained.


   Note that BILF (distributed with the VMS stuff) is not Info-ZIP code;
   it is copyrighted by Rahul Dhesi and is freely distributable.
   The remaining code was written by many people associated with the
   Info-ZIP group, with large contributions from (but not limited to):
   Mark Adler (inflate, explode, funzip), Kai Uwe Rommel (OS/2), John
   Bush and Paul Kienitz (Amiga), and Greg Roelofs (lots of stuff).
   See the file CONTRIBS in the source distribution for a much more
   complete list of contributors.  Also note that, while this code may
   not be explicitly copyrighted, we do request that no one else try
   to copyright it, either.  In other words, use it with our blessings,
   but it's still our code.  Thank you!

   Frequently Asked Questions about distributing Zip and UnZip:


   Q. Can I distribute Zip and UnZip sources and/or executables?

   A. You may redistribute the latest official distributions without
      any modification, and without even asking us for permission.
      [Note that an "executable distribution" includes documentation,
      even if it's in a separate zipfile; plain executables do NOT
      count.]  You can charge for the cost of the media (CDROM, disk-
      ettes, etc.) and a small copying fee.  If you want to distribute
      modified versions please contact us at zip-bugs@wkuvx1.bitnet
      first.  You must not distribute beta versions.
   Q. Can I use the executables of Zip and UnZip to distribute my
      software?

   A. Yes, so long as it is clear that Zip and UnZip are not being
      sold, that the source code is freely available, and that there
      are no extra or hidden charges resulting from its use by or in-
      clusion with the commercial product.  Here is an example of a
      suitable notice:

         NOTE:  <Product> is packaged on this CD using Info-ZIP's
         compression utility.  The installation program uses UnZip
         to read zip files from the CD.  Info-ZIP's software (Zip,
         UnZip and related utilities) is free and can be obtained
         as source code or executables from various anonymous-ftp
         sites, including ftp.uu.net:/pub/archiving/zip/*.


   Q. Can I use the source code of Zip and UnZip in my commercial
      application?

   A. Yes, so long as you include in your product an acknowledgment
      and an offer of the original compression sources for free or
      for a small copying fee, and make clear that there are no extra
      or hidden charges resulting from the use of the compression 
      code by your product.  In other words, you are allowed to sell
      only your own work, not ours.  [Note the additional restrictions
      above on the code in unreduce.c, unshrink.c and vms.c.]  If you
      have special requirements, contact us at zip-bugs@wkuvx1.bitnet.
